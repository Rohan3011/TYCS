This code performs principal component analysis (PCA) on the numeric part of the famous iris dataset. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The first line of code selects the first four columns of the iris dataset (which correspond to the numeric variables: Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, and Petal.Width) and assigns it to a new object called "data_iris".

2. The second line of code calculates the covariance matrix of the "data_iris" object using the "cov()" function and assigns it to a new object called "cov_data".

3. The third line of code finds the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the "cov_data" object using the "eigen()" function and assigns it to a new object called "Eigen_data". Eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each principal component, while eigenvectors represent the direction of the principal component.

4. The fourth line of code performs PCA on the "data_iris" object using the "princomp()" function and assigns it to a new object called "PCA_data". The "cor" argument is set to "False" to indicate that the function should use the covariance matrix instead of the correlation matrix.

5. Finally, the last line of code outputs the eigenvalues of the "Eigen_data" object, which represents the amount of variance explained by each principal component. This is used to compare the output variances of the PCA performed using the "eigen()" function and the "princomp()" function.

Overall, this code performs PCA on the iris dataset and compares the amount of variance explained by each principal component using two different methods.
